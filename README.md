The Code 
--------------
This is the entry point of the app that we spoke on in the previous summary. If the user selects [1] the program calls beginNewOrder and moves straight into the ordering system
The loop and switch statement that I used here is seen throughput my code for many methods such as " addDrink,addSide and checkingOut")

--------------
The Method starts the order and displays the menu's options that the user can choose from. It starts off by creating an order object so everything that the customer wants saves and is added. The application uses the same loop to keep the menu active until the user finishes their order or decides to cancel and exit the app,
This structure also lets the customer add however many items they want from the options listed.
